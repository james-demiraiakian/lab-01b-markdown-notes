# Day 1 Notes

Here are notes for Markdown

# This is a big Header

## This one is smaller

### This one is even smaller

#### And so on and so forth

You can make an Unordered List of things like this:

* This is a ul item.
* Here is another one.
* And a third ul item.
* You can keep doing this as many times as you want.

You can also make an Ordered List, like so:

1. List Item #1
1. List Item #2
1. List Item #3
1. List Item #4
1. List Item #5
1. List Item #6

You can make a table in this manner:

| 1A | 1B | 1C | 1D |
|----|----|----|----|
| 2A | 2B | 2C | 2D |
| 3A | 3B | 3C | 3D |
| 4A | 4B | 4C | 4D |
